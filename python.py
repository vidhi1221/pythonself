# Python

#Python is a interprited, high level , object-oriented with dyanamicly semantic language.

# interpriteted language means - python needs to convert programmer code into machine language code and for that
                                #for that python have compiler and interpretor.
        
# high level language means    - high level language required complier and interpretor for transalte into machine code

# object-oriented language means- It focus on oject code can be reused. Data can be hidden.ojects control on it 

#dyanamically semantic means   - Python knows datatype of stored data 



### Fetures of Python 

# python is platfom independent langauge
# python is high level language 
# python is onject oriented language
# python contain large number of liabary(packages)
# python is dyanamically type language
# python is easy to learn 
# It reduce cost of program maintenance

# compiler and interpretor 


# compiler : -
        # Compiler scans the entire program and translate into machine code at onces
        # Compiler takes a lots of time of analyze source code and execution process is much faster
        # Compiler scan complete program after completion of scanning it show message and its debugginf is harder than interpretor
        # Compiler used by C and C++

# interpretor : -
        # Interpretor scans code line by line 
        # Interpretor takes less time to analyze souce code and execution process is slower
        # It translate the program till first error will come if any error is found it stop working and debugging is easy
        # Interpretor used by JavaScrip And Python
