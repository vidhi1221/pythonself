# operator 

# In python there are some special charater use for perfrome some operation thats called operator 
# like (+, - , * , / , // and many more)
# thats show some relation between operends 

# operends means : - The thats opertor acts on it that called operends

# binary operator : - A operator which requried two operands thats called binary operator 

# All operator have boolean datatype it return only true of false

# types of operator

# Arithmatic Operator : - 
                # +  (additon)
                # -  (substraction)
                # *  (multiplication)
                # /  (dividetion)
                # %  (module " reminder of division")
                # // (floor " Its clear decimal space from reminder and make it into int x // y ")
                # ** (exponent "It used for raising the power of base")

# comparison Or Relational operator : -
                # >  (greater than " x > y")
                # <  (less than " x < y")
                # == ( equal to " x == y")
                # != ( not equal to " x == y")
                # >= (greater than equal to " x >=  y")
                # <= (less than equal to " x <= y")

# Logical Operator : -
                # AND (Check all condition it returns ture if both conditions are true)
                # OR  (check all condition it returns true if at least one condition is true )
                # NOT 

# Assignment Operator : -
                # assignment operator make changes as per the operator and whatever changes did it save in same 
                    # varible (Technically it perform the operation in same varible )
                # assignment operator is mostly use for incrementation and decrementation 
                    # =   (x = 5)
                    # +=  (x += 5)
                    # -=  (x -= 5)
                    # *=  (x *= 5)
                    # /=  (x /= 5)
                    # %=  (x %= 5)
                    # //= (x //= 5)
                    # **= (x **= 5)
                
# Bitwise Operator : -
                # Bitwise operator use for mathmatical expression between operand in binary number
                    # Bitwise & (AND) : - True if all conditions are true 
                    # Bitwise | (OR)  : - True if any One condition is true
                    # Bitwise (NOR)   : - If any condition is true or Both conditions is true its return false 
                    # right_shift(>>) : - It shift place from right side 
                    # left_shift (<<) : - It shift place from left side 

# Membership Operator : -
                # It check the elements are present in sequence or not 
                    # in     : - it return true if element is present either return false 
                    # not in : - It return true if element is not prenest either return false

# Identity Operator   : -
                # It check the id(memory location) of stored data same or not
                    # is     : - it return true if location (id) is same of both data (data stored in same location) either return false 
                    # is not : - it return true if location (id) is not same both data either return false 


# Precedence Operator : -
                # it gives the high preference to evaluation of expression
                # the highiest preference have () paranthisis
                # the lowest preference have membership operator
