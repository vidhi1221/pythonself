# Datatypes

# In python there are three types of datatypes mutable,immutable and boolean

# In mutable datatypes we can make changes with our elements 
    # Types of mutable datatypes 
        # List 
        # set
        # Dictonary

# In immutable datatypes we can not make any types of changes with elements and our data 
    # types of immutable datatypes
        # string
        # tuple
        # fozenset

# Boolean data is mostly use for check condition is true or false 
    # it always return True value either False
